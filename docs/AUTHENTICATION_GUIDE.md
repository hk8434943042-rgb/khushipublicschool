## Database Schema

### Users Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,           -- Unique login username
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,              -- Unique email address
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,             -- Hashed password (PBKDF2-SHA256)
    full_name TEXT,                          -- User's full name
    role TEXT DEFAULT 'admin',               -- User role (admin/teacher/accountant)
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,             -- Account active status
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

## Security Features

### Password Security
- Passwords are hashed using **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** with 100,000 iterations
- Each password has a unique salt
- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- Password verification is performed securely

### Session Management
- Authentication tokens stored in browser's localStorage
- User data is not exposed in localStorage (only user ID and username)
- Automatic session validation on page load
- Session cleared on logout

### Access Control
- Users must be logged in to access the admin dashboard
- Unauthorized users are redirected to login page
- All API endpoints can be secured with role-based access (admin/teacher/accountant)

## Default Test Account

For development/testing, you can create accounts with:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Email**: `admin@school.com`
- **Password**: `admin123` (or any password)

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid username/email or password" Error
- Ensure username or email is spelled correctly
- Check that you're using the correct password
- Remember that passwords are case-sensitive
- Verify that the account exists and is active

### "Username or email already exists"
- The username or email is already registered
- Use a different username or email
- If needed, contact the system administrator to reset the account

### Session Lost / Redirected to Login
- Your session may have expired
- Your browser's localStorage may have been cleared
- Try logging in again
- Check that cookies are enabled in your browser

### Backend Connection Error
- Ensure the Flask backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`
- Check the terminal for any Flask errors
- Verify that CORS is enabled in the backend
