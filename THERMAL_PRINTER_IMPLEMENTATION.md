```bash
# Test thermal endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/receipt/thermal \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"student_name":"Test","roll_no":"001","amount":1000,"payment_method":"Cash","purpose":"Test","receipt_number":"TEST-001","payment_date":"2026-02-26"}'

# Test HTML endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/receipt/html \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"student_name":"Test","roll_no":"001","amount":1000,"payment_method":"Cash","purpose":"Test","receipt_number":"TEST-001","payment_date":"2026-02-26"}'

## Known Limitations

1. **Web Serial API**: Only available in Chrome, Edge, Brave
   - Workaround: Use HTML print as fallback

2. **Paper Width**: Currently optimized for 80mm
   - Workaround: Adjust spacing in backend for 58mm

3. **Image/Logo**: No image support in ESC/POS output
   - Workaround: Use QR code library for code generation

4. **Multiple Copies**: Currently prints one receipt
   - Workaround: Modify backend to add copy count

5. **Batch Printing**: Not implemented
   - Workaround: Print receipts one by one in loop
